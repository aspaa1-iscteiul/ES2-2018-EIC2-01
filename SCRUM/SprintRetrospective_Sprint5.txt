5th Sprint - From May 13 to May 27 (2 weeks)

What went well?
1)	The group presented a great work dynamic
2)	All constituents of the team followed the SCRUM methodology working collaboratively and making significant contributions to improve the features developed in the Sprint. 
3)	During the daily Sprint meetings the different members communicated to the team their progress and impediments to the continuation of the work in a clear way. 
4)	The workload was distributed equally among team members

What did not go as well?
1)	Due to the appearance of a new requirement in the final phase of the work, complications arose that caused a significant delay in delivery.

What should we start doing?
1)	All in all, we should start to make a more realistic planning, prioritizing the essential functionalities and disregarding to some extent the concern with the user’s Quality of Experience (QoE).

What should we keep doing?
1)	At the beginning of Sprint, we set out in a very detailed way the Sprint Backlog tasks on the Trello collaborative work platform. We must continue to do so because this practice has allowed us to have a clear and structured view of the work to be developed during the iteration.
2)	We should continue to resort to Trello checklists to keep track of what still needs to be done.

What should we stop doing?
1)	For the next projects, we must confirm our implementation decisions with the client (teacher) instead of just discussing them as a team. Involving the customer in decision making will allow us to minimize the risk of developing an application that does not conform to customer requirements.
