2st Sprint - From March 11 to March 24 (2 weeks)

What went well?
1)	The group presented a great work dynamic
2)	All constituents of the team followed the SCRUM methodology working collaboratively and making significant contributions to improve the features developed in the Sprint. 
3)	During the daily Sprint meetings the different members communicated to the team their progress and impediments to the continuation of the work in a clear way. 
4)	The workload was distributed equally among team members
5)	The group made a correct estimation of the duration of each task during the Sprint planning meeting.
6)	While implementing the corrective measures prescribed on the Code Inspection Report, we identified other problems, which we corrected in time.

What did not go as well?
1)	Since during the last week of the iteration we had several tests and/or project submission deadlines for other courses, we couldn’t dedicate as much time to this project as in our previous sprint.

What should we start doing?
1)	In the Sprint planning meeting, before defining the sprint tasks, we should take into account our workload during the iteration.

What should we keep doing?
1)	At the beginning of Sprint, we set out in a very detailed way the Sprint Backlog tasks on the Trello collaborative work platform. We must continue to do so because this practice has allowed us to have a clear and structured view of the work to be developed during the iteration.
2)	We should continue to resort to Trello checklists to keep track of what still needs to be done.

What should we stop doing?
1)	For the next iterations, we must confirm our implementation decisions with the client (teacher) instead of just discussing them as a team. Involving the customer in decision making will allow us to minimize the risk of developing an application that does not conform to customer requirements.
