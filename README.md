Development of a software platform for solving tailor-made optimization problems and decision support


As indicated the language adopted for implementation / coding purposes, comments, interaction with the user and documentation
was the English language. However, since the project statement is in Portuguese, we thought it would be more conducive to 
project development if we used our mother tongue for the planning and description of Sprints tasks on the Trello collaborative 
work platform.
